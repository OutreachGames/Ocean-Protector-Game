    --#TODOs Master List- 

    I managed to get stuck twice after answering a question, as in, the game would not ask me to inspect the species, and unlike normally, clicking the species did not make their name pop up. The UI on the right still worked though. But I am unable to reliably reproduce it.

    Finally, at least on my browser, having 0 health for something renders interestingly in the right UI.

Rerun unit tests!

    -- maybe add medals along with bronze, silver, and gold medal achievments as final popup to view?

    -- pause menu has black 1x1 gui square over screen?

    -- add button that takes screenshots of your reef?
    -- find way for boat to move with arrow keys with side view and have particle effect bubbles for movement and white sprite bars for tint selection?


-- Test to confirm fixes
Fixed links to open in new tabs instead of the same tab. 
Fixed capitialization consitency on pH scale inforgraphic.
Updated outcome comments for nutrient pollution where appropriate. 
Fixed final debriefing outcome messages so they will reflect the final player score. 

    -- NOTES 
    --[[
    when changing screens sometimes see minimized screen? 
        seems like might just be slower hardware so might be no way around it...

    should questions be persistent or one-off? 
        IE if player chooses to use a lot of gas in first question, 
        for each question is a negative amount incorporated into each following answer outcome? 
        Nah, this would result in a possible situation where player might have chosen lots of negatives, 
        and when they finally get to a positive it will end up looking like 0 or negative, 
        and that defeats the goal of the game (the goal of the game is to show, 
        that 'Oh I made this decision and it really helped!' and that needs to always be the case, 
        which is possible if each question is just one-off). Also, to be really persistent 
        the game should present all questions at the same time in a different format, like a dash board. 
        This is not very exciting and also make actually grading the thing much trickier. Also was not what was submitted to NOAA.
