	-- only submit to firebase at start, middle, and end (with overwrite of same row, time_started plus IP address + selected number)
	-- students can reopen:
    --   if it was not completed it will resume and further stages can be gone through that might trigger firebase update
	--   when over students can view again but only view final stage and now submit to firebase


    -- NOTES 
    --[[
    make a few more times as oa decreases, and add hash time break
    remake nutrient monitoring, change to using soaps to clean boat and disposing of waste in ocean, still repeat possible?


    firebase takes in every decision and coded functions can then be created to extract data for research purposes
    data submitted after each decision includes ip, user specified id, game specified run number, decision question and submitted answer, time decision started, and time decisions submitted 

    google sheets just has data for ip, user specified id, final game score (0-100), and time submitted

    should questions be persistent or one-off? IE if player chooses to use a lot of gas in first question, for each question is a negative amount incorporated into each following answer outcome? Nah, this would result in a possible situation where player might have chosen lots of negatives, and when they finally get to a positive it will end up looking like 0 or negative, and that defeats the goal of the game (the goal of the game is to show, that 'Oh I made this decision and it really helped!' and that needs to always be the case, which is possible if each question is just one-off). Also, to be really persistent the game should present all questions at the same time in a different format, like a dash board. This is not very exciting and also make actually grading the thing much trickier. Also was not what was submitted to NOAA.
