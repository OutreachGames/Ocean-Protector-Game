    Game:

        Intro
            Coastal OA word! 

            set scene in Southeast Gulf of Mexico, these are species that live there

            link to Great Lakes OA

            important way of life and culturally

            watershed concept, coral symbionts, everyone lives on a watershed that ends up in the ocean

            pull OA and CA definitions from website 

            big thing you can do is share what you have learned 

            shelled organisms like oysters and crabs


            may, maybe, possible to reduce

            sensitive when young and hard to reach adult hood

            less energy for mollusks 



        Questions

            change how boat is used 

            retune question on fish dumping to something else 





    -- maybe add medals along with bronze, silver, and gold medal achievements as final popup to view?

    -- Add menu bar with pause no shake and mute

    -- pause menu has black 1x1 gui square over screen?

    -- add button that takes screenshots of your reef?
    -- find way for boat to move with arrow keys with side view and have particle effect bubbles for movement and white sprite bars for tint selection?


    -- NOTES 
    --[[
    when changing screens sometimes see minimized screen? 
        seems like might just be slower hardware so might be no way around it...

    should questions be persistent or one-off? 
        IE if player chooses to use a lot of gas in first question, 
        for each question is a negative amount incorporated into each following answer outcome? 
        Nah, this would result in a possible situation where player might have chosen lots of negatives, 
        and when they finally get to a positive it will end up looking like 0 or negative, 
        and that defeats the goal of the game (the goal of the game is to show, 
        that 'Oh I made this decision and it really helped!' and that needs to always be the case, 
        which is possible if each question is just one-off). Also, to be really persistent 
        the game should present all questions at the same time in a different format, like a dash board. 
        This is not very exciting and also make actually grading the thing much trickier. Also was not what was submitted to NOAA.
