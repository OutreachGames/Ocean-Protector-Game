    --#TODOs Master List- 

    -- add front that can move through quickly as option to coastal OA, 
    --   also has clouds that hit sun and add timed ocean water color and sky fade
    --   show OA effect with timer in screenplay module
    -- add time delay to next stage progression as option

    -- pause menu has black 1x1 gui square over screen

    -- add bunch of new lines to make popup hud gauge large then add images 
    --   for example, coastal acidification close up then shown in ocean scene
    --   for example, include diagram of CO2 mixing with ocean and increasing acidity, then also show in ocean scene

    -- inject view items and click items after each decision
    --   in other words add stages after each decision to say "now lets view how this looks in our ocean scene"
    -- add dynamic response to OA updates in real time
    --   make sure to never kill all of animal, otherwise no clicking will be possible and game will get stuck
    --   need to make percent changes more dramatic than actual number, since 0.05 change means like 1 fish...

    -- also add summary debrief after clicking on items in each stage 
    --   no extra HUD screen with outcome question since it takes up too much space and player needs to be able to see things
    --   (Decision Outcome Summary: Decision: CO2 emissions or Nutrient Pollution: Ocean Acidity: Ocean Life Health: Your Success: )
    --   'Click 'Continue' to move to next decision'
    -- add message scroll back (just a link to a PDF page with notes all written out, and add this to message along with link at bottom to click to open page )

    -- maybe at last decision it tallies up all decisions and if all correct it sets to highest? (just as failsafe to ensure players can get max)?

    -- add save mechanic (ie fast-forward to i key method with choices saved)
    --   save following:
    --     player_data_tracker_table, goals_shown, stage, substage, player_role, item_data_bar_shown, item_data_goto_shown, item_present
    -- add firebase connection and Google sheets connection
    --  start time, each decision click with time since decisions started


	-- way to load in table of fish group health
	-- way to save table of fish group health 
    -- for saves and level transitions, save position, size, tint, and any other properties of each go (static vs moving)
    -- add button that takes screenshots of your reef?
    -- find way for boat to move with arrow keys with side view and have particle effect bubbles for movement and white sprite bars for tint selection?
    -- after selection, animation of rain or CO2 happens, 
    --   then animations and life update for each life group, 
    --   then player has to click on how to measure, including pH and possibly making a hypothesis
	-- regarding saves, save locally after every decision and show text Auto-saved

	-- only submit to firebase at start, middle, and end (with overwrite of same row, time_started plus IP address + selected number)
	-- students can reopen:
    --   if it was not completed it will resume and further stages can be gone through that might trigger firebase update
	--   when over students can view again but only view final stage and now submit to firebase


    -- NOTES 
    --[[
    make a few more times as oa decreases, and add hash time break
    remake nutrient monitoring, change to using soaps to clean boat and disposing of waste in ocean, still repeat possible?


    firebase takes in every decision and coded functions can then be created to extract data for research purposes
    data submitted after each decision includes ip, user specified id, game specified run number, decision question and submitted answer, time decision started, and time decisions submitted 

    google sheets just has data for ip, user specified id, final game score (0-100), and time submitted

    should questions be persistent or one-off? IE if player chooses to use a lot of gas in first question, for each question is a negative amount incorporated into each following answer outcome? Nah, this would result in a possible situation where player might have chosen lots of negatives, and when they finally get to a positive it will end up looking like 0 or negative, and that defeats the goal of the game (the goal of the game is to show, that 'Oh I made this decision and it really helped!' and that needs to always be the case, which is possible if each question is just one-off). Also, to be really persistent the game should present all questions at the same time in a different format, like a dash board. This is not very exciting and also make actually grading the thing much trickier. Also was not what was submitted to NOAA.
