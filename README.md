*Game Overview*

Ocean Protector is an educational and interactive game that teaches students about the effects of ocean acidification and how they can take action to prevent it. Students begin t the causes and effects of ocean acidification, as well as real-world solutions that can help reduce its impact on marine ecosystems. Following this introduction, students will choose a given role, such as fishing boat captain, marine park ranger, or ocean tour guide. They are then tasked with making decisions for how to reduce OA impacts on their character and marine life. Students will evaluate and select decisions based on the data provided then they will analyze how their decision influenced OA impacts in real-time. This decision-driven experience helps students construct explanations, reason effectively, and become self-directed learners involving OA science and ocean literacy.

The game-based curriculum is currently under development and will be released as free digital program that will be easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

*Educator Information*

If you are an educator, there are multiple resources to help you using Ocean Protector in your classroom. These resources start with a background on OA, which is sourced from the [NOAA Ocean Data Education Project, 2019](https://dataintheclassroom.noaa.gov/ocean-acidification/understanding-ocean-coastal-acidification-teacher-resources). This background and introduction are followed by a structured lesson plan for using Ocean Protector, including sections for Objectives, Background, Materials, and Procedure. Complementary material is also listed, including sections that describe how Ocean Protector aligns with Next Generation Science Standards, an example of Module Integration, and a set of Questions and Answers along with a key. 

If you have additional questions and/or would like a live demonstration in your classroom we would be happy to talk with you! Email is listed at the top of the page here: https://github.com/Ocean-Protector-Game.
