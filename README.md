*Game Overview*

Ocean Protector is an educational and interactive game that teaches students about the effects of ocean acidification and how they can take action to prevent it. Students begin the program by learning causes and effects of ocean acidification, as well as real-world solutions that can help reduce its impact on marine ecosystems. Following this introduction, students will choose a given role, such as fishing boat captain, marine park ranger, or ocean tour guide. They are then tasked with making decisions for how to reduce OA impacts on their character and marine life. Students will evaluate and select decisions based on the data provided then they will analyze how their decision influenced OA impacts in real-time. This decision-driven experience helps students construct explanations, reason effectively, and become self-directed learners involving OA science and ocean literacy.

The game-based curriculum is currently under development and will be released as free digital program that will be easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
